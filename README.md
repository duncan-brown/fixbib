Scripts for fixing bibtex keys in latex documents

People should always pick bibtex keys from *either* [ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) *or* [INSPIRES](https://inspirehep.net/) and never the twain shall meet. They should never invent their own bibtex keys. Unfortunately, this generally never happens, so these are my scripts for fixing it.
